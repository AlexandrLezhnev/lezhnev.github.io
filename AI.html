        Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor developed and distributed by Adobe Systems. The development of the first version of the program under the code name "Picasso" was started in 1985. In January 1987, the first version of the Adobe Illustrator vector editor, written under Classic Mac OS for Apple Macintosh, was released.

        With Adobe's transition to the Creative Cloud subscription system, Illustrator CC was released.
        The latest version, Illustrator CC 25.0, was released in October 2020 and is the 25th generation in the product line.

        In 2018, the computer magazine PC Magazine named Adobe Illustrator the best program for editing vector graphics.
