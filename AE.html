        Adobe After Effects is a software company of Adobe Systems for editing video and dynamic images, developing compositions (compositing), animation and creating various effects. It is widely used in processing of captured video material (color correction, post-production), in creating commercials, music videos, in the production of animation (for television and web), titles for feature and television films, as well as for a number of other tasks that require the use of digital video effects.

        The name comes from an effect known as "persistence (inertia) of visual sensation", this mechanism uses the sensory memory of the retina of the eye, which allows you to store visual information for a short period of time.
