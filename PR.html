        Adobe Premiere Pro is a professional nonâ€”linear video editing program by Adobe Systems. It is the heir of the Adobe Premiere program (the last released version of which was numbered 6.5). The first version of the program (aka Adobe Premiere 1) was released on August 21, 2003 for Windows operating systems. Since the third version, the program has become available for OS X operating systems. The first two versions were released as separate products, the third version was released as part of the Adobe Creative Suite 3 package. Starting from the fifth version, only 64-bit operating systems are supported, while the fourth version was also intended to be used in 32-bit ones. Premiere Pro is used by companies such as The BBC, The Tonight Show.
